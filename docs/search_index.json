Fortunately, with the effort of the University of Michigan Division of Public Safety and Security and FBI, the out-of-state resident who posted the threat was under arrest. However, this event does provoke our attention to public safety (Emma Ruberg and Weinstein). Recently, we view a prerecorded MIDAS seminar on shaping a city with open data presented by Ben Wellington on April 19, 2021. In this talk, Ben Wellington discussed how data science could be applied to urban planning and how open data help political decision-making in New York City. From the geography of parking ticket, to restaurant inspection scores to subway and taxi pricing, he discussed best practices for data science in the policy space, and highlighted the various data-driven interactions he had with city agencies that have led to infrastructure and policy changes (Wellington). Inspired by his talk, we would like to explore in depth about the time patterns and spatial patterns of crimes in Ann Arbor area. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Our research topic is mainly focused on the crime rate in Ann Arbor. Through analyzing and correlating data sources, we aim to create an overview of crime incidents and related factors within Ann Arbor community and the related geo-graphical area. This research will help us gain a deeper understanding of the situation of public security in Ann Arbor for the last two years. Besides, it will also give some guidance for the local residents to avoid potential crime and make decisions in daily life, such as choosing a safer living space from different options, or choosing a safer time and way to travel for some particular areas, etc. Based on the data and further analysis, some questions we would like to answer are as follows: 1. What types of crime are relatively more than others in Ann Arbor? 2. Is public security in Ann Arbor getting better during these years? 3. What days in a week are more dangerous than other days? 4. Which parts of Ann Arbor have more crimes? 5. At what time of day is a particular crime more frequent? 2.2 Data availability The first data source we choose is from the City of Ann Arbor’s Data Catalog website .The City of Ann Arbor’s Data Catalog website is maintained by the local government of the City of Ann Arbor, collected through the reports of incidents in the police department. The data is available in multiple formats for the convenience of viewers, including CSV, PDF, DOC, RSS, KML, and SHP. We prefer to choose CSV, where the file format is used by spreadsheet, database, and statistical applications. We need to import the CSV file as dataframe through coding to import the data. The data catalog will grow over time as more datasets are added, requested and become available. The update frequency of the data is not specified but the latest update is made on 10/31/2022. If researchers have questions about the data, they can contact the police department, for which the detailed contact information is in the “Agency/Unit” column on the left side of the table. Some issues relating to the data quality are known due to sensitivity reasons. To be specific, in the consideration of security problems, some information is omitted from this catalog. Datasets that identify the City’s critical infrastructure assets will not be published. Crime statistics will be aggregated to a city-block level and data that is considered personally identifiable information will not be published. Some sensitive data like residents’ personal information will also be removed. The second data source we choose is from the FBI UCR website. We choose the data because it is an official website of the United States government and thus the data is highly reliable. FBI UCR: 2019 FBI UCR: 2018 FBI UCR: 2017 FBI UCR: 2016 FBI UCR: 2015 The data is collected through the records in Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program by the FBI. Some issues relating to the data quality are known; for instance, the FBI determines that the agency’s data are overreported and thus those data are not included. The data are provided in Excel format, each of which shows the population and the number of different types of crime in different cities in MI for each year. The dataset updates on a yearly basis as a summary of that year, and the latest update is made in 2019. We plan to import the dataset as dataframes in R, and then bind the data of different years together. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.1.1 Data from Ann Arbor Police department The City of Ann Arbor maintains a data catalog on its website that includes police department incident reports. These reports are available in various formats, including CSV, PDF, DOC, RSS, KML, and SHP. For the purpose of this analysis, we will use the CSV format, which is compatible with spreadsheet, database, and statistical software. The dataset includes about 5400 observations with variables case number, crime type, incident address, date, etc. The data catalog is regularly updated, although the specific update frequency is not specified. The most recent update was made on 10/31/2022. Researchers with questions about the data can contact the police department using the contact information provided in the ‘Agency/Unit’ column of the table. Some known issues with the data quality exist due to security concerns. For example, datasets that identify critical infrastructure assets will not be published, and crime statistics will be aggregated to a city-block level. Additionally, some personally identifiable information and sensitive data, such as residents’ personal information, will be removed. 3.1.2 Data from FBI UCR Program The datasets are collected by FBI through UCR Program, each provides the number of violent crime (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) and property crime (burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft) as reported by city and town law enforcement agencies that contributed data to the UCR Program in cities of Michigan for each year. One problem of the data sets is that the columns are not independent to each other: the value of column Violent Crime is the sum of the values of the subsequent 4 columns and the value of column Property Crime is the sum of the subsequent 3 columns. What’s more, Arson is an independent crime type in the table, not included in violent crime or property crime. Another problem is that the data is updated only to 2019. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.2.1 Data from Ann Arbor Police department Cleveland plot: Numbers of cases under different categories As we can see from the overview of the dataset, the crimes are divided into different categories, where each category is followed by a description for the sub-category. Since we aim to see the counts of the events for each category in total, we need to preprocess the data by transforming the column CATEGORY to a uniform form. To do this, we split strings in the CATEGORY column of a crime data frame by either ” - ” or ” / “, depending on which delimiter is present. If either delimiter is found, the code replaces the original string with the first element from the resulting split. Time Series plot Column DATE provides us both the date and time for the crime incidents, while we only need the date for our monthly time series plot. Thus we will remove the extra information and extract the dates and months by splitting the string. First, the code uses a for loop to iterate over the DATE column in the crime data frame. For each value in the DATE column, the code uses the str_split() function to split the value by the space character (’ ‘). This results in a list of two elements: the date and the time. The code then assigns the first element (the date) to the corresponding position in the date column. Next, the code uses a second for loop to iterate over the DATE column again. For each value in the DATE column, the code uses the str_split() function to split the value by the dash character (’-’). This results in a list of three elements: the year, the month, and the day. The code then assigns the second element (the month) to the corresponding position in the month column. When working on the time series plot for the number of cases during each day, I transformed the “DATE” column in the following ways: I first loop through each row, split the string by ” “, and retain the first element as”date”. I stored them in a new column named “date”. To find the number of cases during each month, I looped through each row in the “date” column, split the string by “-”, and retained the first element as “month”. I stored them in a new column named “month”. When working on the time series plot for the number of cases during each hour, I transformed the “DATE” column in the following ways: I first looped through each row, split the string by ” “, and retained the second element as”time”. I then split the data by “:” and retained the second element as “hour”. Heatmaps The available data is the latitudes and longitudes of crimes. To get a better sense of the number of cases occurred in each area, I first split the longitude ranges and latitude ranges into 5 segments for each. Then, I loop through the entire dataset and counted the number of crimes that occurred within each of the 25 areas based on the longitude ranges and latitude ranges. 3.2.2 Data from FBI UCR Program Each data set contains the numbers of different types of crimes in cities of Michigan for each year. I construct two dataframes for usage. The columns for the 10 files are all in the character form, so for the very first step, I transfered all columns to the nemeric form. For the first data frame, I first computed the crime rates(Crime number / Population) for two summarized type of crimes - violent crime and property crime and added the values to two new columns. Then I chose 20 rows with highest population for comparison. For the second data frame, I selected the data of Ann Arbor for each year from the 10 files, then I changed the column names to the same one, added a new column showing the year of data to each file, and combined them all together. The third data frame is tidydata. I used the data of 2019 from the first data frame constructed as explained above, and transformed it to tidydata version. 3.3 Missing value analysis The dataset PartABCrimeOffenses(from Ann Arbor police department) has no extra title name which might occupy the columns or rows, and the data for all columns, includinhg CASE_NUM, CRIME_DESC, CHARGE_CODE, CHARGE_DESC, CRIME_PART, ADDRESS, CITY, DATE, CATEGORY, POINT_X, POINt_Y, are all filled. Thus the dataset is complete with no missing values, and there is no need for removing missing data. For the dataset from FBI URB Program, there are 0.47% missing values for Variable Burglary in the data “df2019.csv”, but since we only use the data of 20 cities with highest population of the data set, it is totally acceptable and thus we do not have to solve the missing data problem. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Is Ann Arbor a relatively dangerous city in Michigan? 4.2 What type of crimes happen the most? 4.3 Which month does the crime cases happen the most frequently? 4.4 What day do the crime cases happen the most often? 4.5 In what time of a day do the cases happen more often? 4.6 In which part of the city do the cases happen more often? 4.7 Is public security in Ann Arbor getting better during these years?", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Is Ann Arbor a relatively dangerous city in Michigan? For the purpose of comparison with Ann Arbor, we care more about the public safety situation of big cities in Michigan. Among the 20 cities with highest population, Detroit is the only outlier. We would like to explore in another way that if Ann Arbor has a higher crime rate. Obviously, in terms of whichever, property crime rate or violent crime rate, the value of Ann Arbor is near the middle of the data. The two graphs above indicate that Ann Arbor is not an obviously dangerous (with large number or higher rate of crimes) city in Michigan. 4.2 What type of crimes happen the most? As we can tell from the plot, property crime in Ann Arbor is much more common than violent crime. In 2019, the FBI reported a total of 2124 property crimes, compared with 309 violent crimes. The most common type of property crime in 2019 was larceny theft, followed by burglary and motor vehicle theft. Among violent crimes, aggravated assault was the most common type, followed by robbery, rape, and murder. The above plot used the data collected by FBI, and as a result, although the cases are clearly clarified into two main categories, but it does not include all detailed types of crimes. Let’s see a more detailed version, whose data is collected by local police department in Ann Arbor. It can be told that the types of crimes that have the most counts during the past 366 days are Larceny, Assault and FRAUD. In particular, Larceny has 1628 cases in total, Assault has 787 cases in total, and FRAUD has 533 cases in total. You should really be careful about your own items in Ann Arbor. 4.3 Which month does the crime cases happen the most frequently? We can first see the distribution of the number of crime incidents for the whole year in the following barplot. Both the barplot and the time series plot summarize the monthly number of crime cases in a chronological order. The time series plot gives a clearer and more straight-forward view of the change of numbers among different months. It can be told from the graph that September, October, and May have the most cases compared to any other month of year 2022. Number of cases reache the lowest in April. From the overview of the whole year, the frequency of cases in the second half of the year is more than that in the first half of the year. 4.4 What day do the crime cases happen the most often? We specifically take a look at the following three months that have the most cases of crimes for analysis: May, September, and October. According to time series plot: in May, 05/01, 05/07, 05/10, 05/13, 05/19, 05/22, 05/25 have a relatively high occurrence of cases. in September, we can see the cases is relatively high on 09/04, 09/11, 09/17, 09/24, and 09/29, which reach the highest on 09/17. in October, we can see the cases is extremely high on 10/30, comparing to any other days in that month. 10/06, 10/09, 10/15, 10/22 have a relatively high occurrence of cases. When comparing the cases peeks among all the dates, we find that there is no fixed pattern for daily number of occurrence of crime cases. Although the highest number of occurrence among a month are not always on weekends, we notice that crimes occur relatively more frequently on weekends especially on Sunday. 4.5 In what time of a day do the cases happen more often? 4.5.1 Time Series Plot among 24 hours of a day ## # A tibble: 24 × 2 ## hour count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 00 362 ## 2 01 294 ## 3 02 351 ## 4 03 271 ## 5 04 171 ## 6 05 127 ## 7 06 98 ## 8 07 88 ## 9 08 135 ## 10 09 182 ## # … with 14 more rows From the data of the past 366 days, we summarized the total number of cases at each hour during a day. It can be told from the graph that the typical hours that have the most crime cases are 12am, 12pm, 1am and 2am. The reasons behind would be that during late time at night, there are fewer people outside, thus it is more convenient for crimes to occur as there are fewer witnesses and people who can help and stop crimes. It is also noticeable that from 1pm to 7pm, cases are relatively fewer than those at peek times, but still are quite high. 4.6 In which part of the city do the cases happen more often? 4.6.1 heatmap for different locations (x, y coordiantes) max(crime$POINT_X) ## [1] -83.01426 min(crime$POINT_X) ## [1] -84.39088 max(crime$POINT_Y) ## [1] 42.39456 min(crime$POINT_Y) ## [1] 42.1513 consider point_x : -83 ~ -84.4 -84.4 ~ -84.12; -84.12 ~ -83.84; -83.84 ~ -83.56; -83.56 ~ -83.28; -83.28 ~ -83; consider point_y: 42.15 ~ 42.40 42.15 ~ 42.2; 42.2 ~ 42.25; 42.25 ~ 42.3; 42.3 ~ 42.35; 42.35 ~ 42.4; Comments: We set the ranges of point x and point y into 5 pieces each, and then calculated the total cases among each district. The shade of the blue from brightest to darkeet represents the variation of number of cases from high to low. It can be told from the graph that the areas with most crime cases are as follows: 42.25° N ~ 42.3° N, 83.56° W, 83.84° W. In those areas, the total number of cases during the past 366 days is 5451. 4.7 Is public security in Ann Arbor getting better during these years? During the past 10 years between 2010 and 2019, Violent crime number and rate in Ann Arbor has an increasing trend while Property crime number and rate has a decreasing trend. Clearly, public safety does not change a lot in the past 10 years. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component For the D3 project, I managed to visualize the barchart of the number of crime cases of each month in the year 2022. In particular, I added 12 columns to illustrate the number of cases in each month. On each column, I labeled the case numbers. The interaction and transitivity parts lie as follows: When the web page is open, the colors of all columns slowly transform from white to light blue. When users click on any of the twelve columns, the column color will change from light blue to light green. The findings are as follows: The months that have the most cases in the year 2022 include September, October, and May. September has the largest number of crime cases: 538. October has 517 cases. May has 493 cases. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion Key takeaways: The types of crimes that have the most counts in 2022 are larceny, assault, and fraud. The frequency of cases in the second half of the year is more than that in the first half of the year, where September, October, and May have the most cases compared to any other month of the year 2022. Crimes occur relatively more frequently on weekends especially on Sunday. Typical hours that have the most crime cases are 12am, 12pm, 1am and 2am. The areas with the most crime cases in Ann Arbor are in the middle of the city, 42.25° N ~ 42.3° N, 83.56° W, 83.84° W. Limitations: Since we did not find updated dataset of 2022 in the second dataset, we analyze the crime cases in 2022 for the first one and 2019 for the second one, which prevents us from comparing our conclusions for the crime issues for the same year. We draw our conclusions based on the dataset in 2019 and 2022, while where these conclusions can be generalized to other years is still to be determined. Some crimes that are not reported may not be analyzed in our project. Further directions: For the question “which part of Ann Arbor is more dangerous,” we plan to use the heatmap next time to notice the sub-region of the city. The data analysis in this project only discusses the crime cases in 2022. We can analyze more data in the past few years to check whether our findings can be generalized. Conduct similar research to other nearby cities and analyze the safety level of the county or Michigan. Lessons learned: Cleveland dot plot seems to be more straightforward than barplot when the variables are in a great number and the names of the variables are relatively long. Perceptually uniform color spaces are useful in determining the difference between the frequency of variables, since perceived differences are proportional to scalar differences.
